To create a calculator website, we will use Flask, a Python micro web framework, along with HTML and CSS for the frontend. We will have a main Python script to run the Flask application, a HTML file for the frontend interface, and a CSS file for styling.

Here are the core files, classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.py`: This is the main Python script that will run our Flask application. It will contain the `Calculator` class with methods for basic arithmetic operations and a route to handle POST requests from the frontend.

2. `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML file that will provide the frontend interface of our calculator. It will contain a form for user input and buttons for each arithmetic operation.

3. `static/styles.css`: This is the CSS file that will provide styling for our calculator.

4. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies that need to be installed for our application to run.

Now, let's write the content of each file.

`app.py`
